                Extreme g-forces. Daring decisions made in the blink of an eye – and at 370km/h. 
                Dramatically battling to be the best, Formula 1 drivers are more like fighter pilots 
                than sportspeople. Only 10 people get the chance to compete, and they push themselves – 
                and their incredible machines – to the very limit.

            <p>Formula 1 is a sport where 10 different car brands compete with eachother in races with their own built formula 1 car. <br> It's classed as a sport because the driver needs a fit body and a muscly neck for the g-force the car creates when turning at such a high speed. <br> Find out more about this sport on this website.</p>
